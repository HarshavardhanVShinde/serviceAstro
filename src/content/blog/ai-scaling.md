The biggest companies in the world—Google, Amazon, Netflix—all have one thing in common: they use **Artificial Intelligence** to drive decision-making. But AI isn't just for giants anymore. Small and medium businesses are using custom AI solutions to outperform competitors.

## Where Can You apply AI?

### 1. Customer Support (Chatbots)
Forget clunky automated messages. Modern AI chatbots (like those powered by OpenAI) can hold human-like conversations, resolving 80% of customer queries instantly without human intervention.

### 2. Predictive Analytics
AI can analyze your sales data to predict future trends. Imagine knowing exactly which products will sell out next month, or which customers are at risk of churning.

### 3. Personalized Marketing
Netflix knows what you want to watch before you do. Your business can do the same. AI algorithms can recommend products to users based on their browsing history, drastically increasing conversion rates.
