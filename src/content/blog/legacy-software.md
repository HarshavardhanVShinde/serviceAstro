"If it ain't broke, don't fix it." 
In software, this is a dangerous mindset. Legacy systems—outdated software that runs critical business processes—are silent killers of growth.

## The Risks of Outdated Tech

*   **Security Vulnerabilities**: Old systems stop receiving security patches, making them easy targets for ransomware attacks.
*   **High Maintenance Costs**: Finding developers who know 15-year-old languages is difficult and expensive.
*   **Incompatibility**: Legacy systems often can't integrate with modern tools like Stripe, Slack, or AI APIs, leaving your business isolated.

## The Solution: Modernization
Refactoring or rewriting your software key components isn't an expense; it's an investment. Moving to the cloud, adopting microservices, or simply upgrading your frontend to a modern framework like **React** or **Astro** can reduce hosting costs by 40% and improve speed by 200%.

Don't let your code hold you back.
